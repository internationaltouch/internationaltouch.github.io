# FIT Concussion Policy

## Purpose of policy

The purpose of this policy is to provide event managers, stakeholders and participants with a
uniform process for recognising and managing concussions sustained in Federation Events.

## Policy scope and application

This policy applies to all Federation Events and to all participants of Member countries competing
at any Federation Event. Member countries are encouraged to apply this policy to all events that are
not afforded Federation Event status.

Copies of the Policy and supporting document can be obtained from the Federation website.

## Definitions

Concussion
:   is a brain injury that involves a disturbance in brain function rather than a structural injury
    to the brain. It is caused by direct or indirect force to the head, face, neck or elsewhere with
    the force transmitted to the head. A player does not have to be knocked unconscious to have a
    concussion. Loss of consciousness is seen in only 10-15% of cases of concussion.

Concussion Recognition Tool 5™ (CRT5)
:   is a pocket-sized checklist that helps stakeholders to recognise the signs and symptoms of
    concussion and determine the need to remove a player from the field (Appendix 1).

Graduated Return to Play (GRP)
:   refers to the process of recovery and then return to sport following a concussion. This involves
    a graduated stepwise rehabilitation strategy as outlined in Table 1 (Appendix 4). This table
    has been modified.

FIT Concussion Referral and Return Form
:   The FIT Concussion Referral and Return Form consist of three sections, each of which must be
    completed for players suspected of sustaining a concussion (Appendix 2).

Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5 (SCAT5)
:   is a standardised tool for evaluating concussions designed for use by **physicians and licensed
    healthcare professionals**. The SCAT5 can be administered in 10-20 minutes (Appendix 3).

## Regulatory background and acknowledgements

The advice in this document reflects current best practice for the management of concussion in sport
and draws upon information provided in a number of existing documents, including:

-   The consensus statement on concussion in sport (McCrory et. al, 2017).
-   Concussion in Sport Policy (Sports Medicine Australia, 2018).
-   Rugby Australia Concussion Guidance (Rugby Australia, 2018).
-   Management of Concussion in Rugby League (National Rugby League, 2017).

## Policy statement

FIT is committed to providing and encouraging a safe, fair and inclusive environment for everyone
involved in the organisation and within all levels of our sport delivery. This policy is intended to
set out minimum guidelines around recognising and managing concussion and is not intended to serve
as medical document. At all times, stakeholders (players/athletes, coaches, officials,
administrators, parents/guardians (of child participants), first aid attendants, medical staff,
spectators) need to act in the best interest of player safety and welfare and this requirement
overrides all other considerations.

It is a requirement that all players who suffer a concussion seek the highest level of medical care
reasonably available to ensure concussion is managed appropriately.

An individual may report a possible violation of the Concussion Policy either verbally, in writing
or by email. The report should provide full details of the alleged violation to the extent known by
the individual. The report may be made anonymously. An individual may make a report to the relevant
official at the level of sport delivery that the breach occurred.

## FIT Concussion policy

The management of concussion should involve the following steps, with each step followed before
moving onto the next step

On the day of the injury:

1.  Recognise
2.  Remove
3.  Record
4.  Refer

On the days following the injury:

1.  Rest
2.  Recover
3.  Reconsider & record
4.  Return

### Recognise

Only medical professionals can definitively diagnose a concussion, however recognising the potential
signs and symptoms of a suspected concussion is relatively simple. It is the responsibility of
**all** Touch stakeholders, including players, parents, coaches, officials, teachers and trainers to
recognise and remove players exhibiting the signs and symptoms of a potential concussion. This is
particularly important to ensure appropriate management and to prevent further injury. Symptoms can
come on at any time, but usually within 24-48 hours after a collision. If recognised and
appropriately managed, most people (70-80%) will recover from their symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks of
their injury; however, the rate of recovery varies from person to person.

Children and adolescents are more susceptible to concussion, typically take longer to recover and
are more susceptible to rare and dangerous neurological complications, including death caused by a
single or second impact. Concussion that is ignored or not recognised can be fatal, therefore:

-   All potential concussions should be taken seriously.
-   Children and adolescents must be treated more conservatively than adults.
-   All players with potential head injury or concussion must be removed from the field immediately.
-   Return to play or training on the same day is not permitted for any potential head injury or
    concussion.

Prior to commencement of the event, Event Managers will ensure that an official from each team and
every referee is supplied with a copy of the pocket Concussion Recognition Tool 5™ (CRT5). This tool
helps stakeholders recognise the signs and symptoms of concussion and determine the need to remove a
player from the field (Appendix 1).

Each team should also be provided with copies of the FIT Concussion Referral and Return Form
(Appendix 2). The FIT Concussion Referral and Return Form consist of three sections, each of which
must be completed.

The use of this tool should be discussed at all pre-event briefings, preferably by the Event Medical
Officer. Referees and team officials (coaches, managers, trainers) should familiarise themselves
with this tool prior to the tournament commencing. Any questions in regards to the use of the CRT
should be directed towards the designated medical officer in the first instance or Event officials
if/when the Event Medical Officer is not available.

**Note:** Although tools like the CRT5 can help to recognise concussion, they are not a replacement
for a comprehensive medical assessment.

### Remove

Initial management must adhere to first aid rules, including airway, breathing, circulation and
spinal immobilisation.

Players with a suspected concussion should be immediately removed from the field of play.

In most circumstances a suspected concussion will occur following a knock to the head or a
significant collision. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the referee to immediately stop
play and ensure that the player is safely removed from the field of play. The player's number should
be noted on the scorecard and they should not be allowed to return to the field of play until
medically assessed.

In some cases, a player may be interchanged without the knowledge of the referee or may develop
symptoms and signs sometime after a collision. In these cases, it is the responsibility of team
officials to use the CRT5 to assess for signs and symptoms of concussion. If a concussion is
suspected or if there is any doubt, it is the responsibility of a team official to notify match
officials that a player has been removed. This can be achieved by informing the referee nearest to
their substitute box that a player has been removed due to a suspected concussion. This referee
should stop play at the next break in play and record the number of the player on the scorecard.

Players with a suspected concussion should:

-   Not be left alone (until medically assessed or for at least the first 1–2 hours).
-   Not be allowed to return to the current game or any other game held on the same day unless
    cleared by a medical practitioner. Officials should not be influenced by the player, team
    officials (coach, manager, trainer), parents or other stakeholders suggesting that they should
    return to play.
-   Not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs.
-   Not take certain prescription medications including aspirin, anti-inflammatory medications,
    sedative medications or strong pain-relieving medications
-   Not be sent home by themselves.
-   Not drive a motor vehicle
-   Be referred to a medical practitioner for completion of an appropriate medical assessment.

**Note:** a player with a headache post-game that did not exhibit any signs or symptoms during the
game, nor observed to have had a head knock, is not classified as concussed.

### Record

Any player removed from the field of play with a potential concussion should be recorded in the
allotted space on the referee's scorecard.  When the scorecard is returned to the Event Manager, the
referees should communicate that a player has been removed in line with the FIT Concussion Policy.
Event Managers should also review all scorecards to check whether any player has been removed due to
a suspected concussion.

The Event Manager should ensure the details of this player are centrally recorded so that this
player cannot return to the field of play until medically assessed.

It is the responsibility of the team officials to complete Section 1 of the FIT Concussion Referral
and Return Form and to hand this form to the Event Medical Officer; this formally starts the
referral process.

### Refer

All players with a suspected concussion need a medical assessment by a medical practitioner.

Where feasible, Team Officials should contact Tournament Control/Event Administration to notify them
of the need for a concussion assessment by the Event Medical Officer. The Event Manager will notify
the Medical Officer Prompt notification will allow for completion of an immediate/on field
assessment as soon as possible. The Medical Officer is advised to use part 1 of the SCAT5 as part of
their assessment.

**Note: If there are serious concerns about the player or red flags, then the player must be
referred to an Emergency Department as soon as possible or call an ambulance.**

After completing Section 1 of the FIT Concussion Referral and Return Form, Team Officials should
forward this form promptly to the Event Medical Officer. It is then the medical officer's
responsibility to complete an assessment and sign Section 3 of the FIT Concussion Referral and
Return Form.

On rare occasions an Event Medical Officer will not be present or not feel confident in completing
the FIT Concussion Referral and Return Form. In these cases, the from should be provided to a local
general practice or a doctor in a hospital emergency department. Ideally, the medical doctor who
reviews the player should have experience in the assessment and management of sports concussion.

In line with the Berlin Consensus statement of concussion in sport, the medical assessment should
include "*a comprehensive history and detailed neurological examination including: a) thorough
assessment of mental status, cognitive functioning, sleep/wake disturbance, ocular function,
vestibular function, gait and balance: b) Determination of the clinical status of the patient,
including whether there has been improvement or deterioration since the time of injury. This may
involve seeking additional information from parents, coaches, teammates and eyewitnesses to the
injury. c) Determination of the need for emergent neuroimaging to exclude a more severe brain injury
(e.g., structural abnormality)."*

Once the medical officer has signed Section 3 of the FIT Concussion Referral and Return Form, the
form should be returned to the Event Manager. The Event Manager should ensure that the decision
around medical clearance has been recorded centrally.

A player deemed not to have sustained a concussion may return to the field of play.

**Any players diagnosed with concussion will not be able to play again in that touch tournament.**
This is because best evidence indicates that it takes a minimum of 1 week to proceed through the
Graduated Return to Play (GRP) protocols. Players diagnosed by a medical practitioner as having
sustained a concussion should follow the GRP as outlined in Steps 5 to 8.

The Event Manager should also ensure that the athlete and team officials are provided with a copy of
the FIT Concussion Referral and Return Form and the Graduated Return to Play table (Appendix 4).
This will assist the athlete in recovering from their concussion with the assistance off their
member nation and local medical support.

### Rest

**While these steps may begin during the FIT Event, they are likely to continue in the weeks after
the Event concludes. Therefore, it is the responsibility of Team Officials and Member Associations
to ensure that the player receives the appropriate medical clearance.**

Most people will recover from a concussion within 10 to 14 days; however, rest is crucial to recover
from a concussion. Complete physical and cognitive rest is recommended immediately following a
concussion (24–48 hours). The time required for complete rest will vary from player to player and
the decision to increase activity is based on the absence of signs and symptoms.

Rest means not undertaking any activity that provokes symptoms and may include the following:

-   Resting quietly at home
-   Missing a day or two from study or work.
-   Going for a gentle walk outside / around the block
-   Limiting any tasks that require prolonged focus, memory or concentration
-   Avoiding excessive TV, use of mobile devices, gaming, computers and phones as these can
    aggravate symptoms.

After this brief period of rest, athletes are encouraged to become gradually and progressively more
active as long as they do not experience any symptoms (i.e. activity level should not bring on or
worsen their symptoms). Athletes should avoid vigorous exertion while they are recovering.

### Recover - Graduated return to play

Managing concussion is a shared responsibility between the player, Team Officials and medical
practitioner. Open communication is essential and information should be shared. A player who has
suffered a concussion should return to sport gradually. They should increase their exercise
progressively, as long as they remain symptom-free, following the stages outlined in Table 1
(Appendix 4). Each stage of progression should take at least 24 hours so that athletes would take a
minimum of 1 week to proceed through the full rehabilitation protocol; if any symptoms worsen during
activity, the athlete should go back to the previous stage. In athletes who experience prolonged
symptoms and resultant inactivity, each step may take longer than 24hours.

**Note:** The time frame for returning to play may vary with player age, history, level of sport,
etc., and management must be individualised. As children and adolescents often take longer to
recover from a concussion than adults, it is suggested the graduated return to play protocol should
be extended such that a child does not return to contact/collision activities less than 14 days from
the resolution of all symptoms.

### Reconsider and record

Prior to returning to the field of play, a participant that sustained a concussion at a FIT event
should seek medical clearance. Given the nature of FIT events, it will not be possible for the Event
Medical Officer to provide this clearance. Therefore, the athlete is advised to contact their
general practitioner on returning home and organise to have medical clearance. Again, once the FIT Event concludes, it is the responsibility of Team Officials and Member Associations to ensure that
the player receives the appropriate medical clearance. FIT advises the athlete and Member
Association to provide the local medical officer with a copy of the complete FIT Concussion Referral
and Return Form as this will provide them with a background of the injury.

**Note: It is not ideal to seek medical clearance from inexperienced medical doctors who do not know
the medical history of the player (e.g., junior hospital emergency room doctors).**

### Return to Play

A player should only return to play when they have fully recovered from concussion. This means the
player must:

-   Not have any signs or symptoms of concussion at rest or in normal daily activities (school,
    study, or work).
-   Have followed the mandatory required rest time away from cognitive and physical activity.
-   Have successfully completed the GRP without any symptoms or signs of concussion (during or after
    training).
-   Have received medical clearance to play.
