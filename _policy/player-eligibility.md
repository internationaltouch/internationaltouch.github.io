# FIT Player Eligibility Policy

## Introduction

1.  Player eligibility for international sporting competition can be a complex and often emotive
    issue. The defining elements are at the very heart of global competition and key issues involved
    in ascertaining eligibility include aspects of nationality, passport, residency, place of birth,
    playing history, the respective country's selection process and even a player's gender, birth
    date and age.
2.  A player's eligibility to represent a country requires some form of direct link between the
    individual and the represented country. The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)
    has ruled that Legal Nationality and Sporting Nationality may be "different", one defined in
    Public Law and the other in Private Law.
3.  The Federation of International Touch (the Federation) therefore has the authority to decide
    eligibility criteria for participants in the sport in the international arena as governed by the
    Federation and Member Country National Touch Associations (NTA). Specific eligibility criteria
    may differ from Legal Nationality and should be subject to any internationally endorsed anti
    discrimination or equality policies. The focus of this Eligibility Policy is that the criteria
    are both fair and equitable to most.
4.  The Federation also agrees that the basis of International Sport should be just that, about
    individuals competing for their country against individuals from another country and any
    competing national team should be a Member Country NTA representative national team.

## Application

1.  This policy applies to all Federation Events classified as Tier 1 to Tier 3 as defined in the
    Classification of Events policy.
2.  This policy applies to all participants of Member countries competing at any Federation Event.
    Member countries are responsible to ensure all individuals representing that Member country meet
    the eligibility criteria prior to participation at a Federation Event.
3.  Member countries are encouraged to apply this policy to all events that are not afforded
    Federation Event status.
4.  This eligibility policy applies to representative players registered in national teams. The
    policy does not apply to officials, coaches, referees, support staff or to representative
    players under eighteen (18) years of age.

## Definitions

    of an individual. For the purposes of this policy a certified copy of a Birth Certificate or

    a country's criteria for being a legitimate national.

12. **Passport:** An official document issued by a government department certifying nationality of a
    country and used by an individual for international travel.
13. **Place of Birth:** The location of birth as recorded on an individual's Birth Certificate.
14. **Represented:** An individual listed on the player registration sheet for a Member country

    country. "Representation" shall be interpreted accordingly.

        and where the individual's last Representation was the previous running of the same Tier 1
        event.

    participate in Federation events, an individual must also meet:

        will specify the criteria;
    4.  Solely in the event that the individual has previously Represented another Member country
        and relies upon clauses 4.1.2 or 4.1.3 to satisfy the requirements of clause 4.1, the
        following additional requirements must have been met during the two (2) years immediately
        preceding the date of the individual's application for eligibility in respect of the new

            club within the Member country they intend to Represent.
    5.  The requirements of clause 4.3.4 may be waived by FIT, upon application by an individual, in
        the event that the individual's failure to satisfy the requirements were outside of the
