# FIT Player Eligibility Policy

## Introduction

1.  Player eligibility for international sporting competition can be a complex and often emotive
    issue. The defining elements are at the very heart of global competition and key issues involved
    in ascertaining eligibility include aspects of nationality, passport, residency, place of birth,
    playing history, the respective country's selection process and even a player's gender, birth
    date and age.
2.  A player's eligibility to represent a country requires some form of direct link between the
    individual and the represented country. The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)
    has ruled that Legal Nationality and Sporting Nationality may be "different", one defined in
    Public Law and the other in Private Law.
3.  The Federation of International Touch, therefore, has the authority to decide eligibility
    criteria for participants in the sport in the international arena as governed by the Federation
    and NTOs. Specific eligibility criteria may differ from Legal Nationality and should be subject
    to any internationally endorsed anti-discrimination or equality policies. The focus of this
    Eligibility Policy is that the criteria are both fair and equitable to most.
4.  The Federation also agrees that the basis of International Sport should be just that, about
    individuals competing for their country against individuals from another country and any
    competing national team should be a representative national team organized by the national
    governing body of the relevant National Touch Organisation (NTO).

### Application

1.  This policy applies to all Federation Events attracting test caps where National Touch
    Associations (NTOs) play against each other.
2.  This policy applies to all players competing at any Federation Event. NTOs are responsible for
    ensuring all individuals representing that Member meet the eligibility criteria prior to
    participating in a Federation Event.
3.  NTOs are encouraged to apply this policy to all events that are not afforded Federation Event
    status.
4.  This policy does not apply to officials, coaches, referees, or support staff.

### Definitions

Junior international representation
:   means any person who represents a National Touch Organisation such match being sanctioned and
recognised by FIT and the NTO in which that person is under 18 years of age. A player is not bound
to represent the NTO once that player reaches 18 years of age. A player who has reached 18 years of
age must meet the eligibility criteria as detailed in clause (2).

FIT
:   is the acronym for the Federation of International Touch.

FIT Authorising Officers
:   means any person mandated by FIT to Validate a player's eligibility to play International Touch.

Continuous Resident
:   An individual who has maintained their domicile in one Country or territory except for short
periods of absence away from the normal place of residence for holidays, business travel or
similar short trips. When defining the permitted length of a period of absence, the guideline of
"a few weeks but no longer than a few months" is to apply.

Grandparent
:   means either a biological/blood grandparent or the parent of the player or a person who has
adopted the player in accordance with the legal or recognised requirements of the country concerned.
Indigenous accepted practices on adoption will be recognised. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
possible for a player to establish eligibility pursuant to Rule (2) through a parent of an adopted
parent.

NTO
:   is the acronym for a National Touch organisation.

Parent
:   means either a biological/blood parent of the player or a person who has adopted the player in
accordance with the legal requirements of the country concerned. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
possible for a player to establish eligibility pursuant to Rule (2) through a parent of an adopted
parent.

Passport
:   is an official document issued by a government department certifying nationality, the status of
an individual in respect of a Country and used by an individual for international travel.

Principal place of Residence
:   means a place or location in which a player has their primary home for each of the
following.<br>
(i)  Tier one nation two years<br>
(ii)  Tier two nation two years<br>
(iii)  Senior division player two years<br>
immediately prior to FIT Sanctioned events and subsequent to establishing his/her initial residency
eligibility and playing for the NTO of choice can represent that NTO regardless of residency status.
For full-time students who are residents in another NTO, the period spent studying abroad can be
determined as temporary absences(s) that will not affect the eligibility period concerned.
For the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of the respective period of residency shall commence
from the day on which the player’s eligibility becomes active and cannot include any period forward
of such eligibility date.

Stand Down Period
:   means the 2-year period required for a player wishing to represent another NTO. The Two year
Period commences from the last date that a player represented an NTO that he/she has most recently
represented.

"FIT will group International Bi-Annual tiered tournaments (eg Regional Championships or Trans
Tasman Series). They will require a full tournament stand down where the dates between editions do
not link to the 2-year window. This will be made clear in the tournament entry and eligibility
documents."

Tier One Nation
:   means any nation determined to be a Tier One Nation by FIT

Tier Two Nation
:   means any nation determined not to be a Tier One Nation by FIT

## Eligibility

1. A Player is eligible to play an international match for
    1. The nation in which the player is born.
    2. The nation in which either of the player's parents was born.
    3. The nation in which either of the player's grandparents was born.
    4. The nation which is the player's principal place of residence
2. a player who maintains eligibility for both a tier-one nation and a tier-two nation must nominate
   which nation the player elects to play for in an international event prior to the closing date
   for final registrations for that event. A player from a tier-one nation not selected for that
   nation can represent a tier-two nation that they are eligible to represent without needing to
   meet the two-year stand-down period. Such players would be able to be available for selection by
   their original nation at the next event that the nation participates in.
    1. Tier one nations are required to declare which dual-qualified players have been selected for
       the international event final squads a minimum of two weeks prior to the closing date for
       final nominations.
    2. Tier one nations are required to declare which dual-qualified players have been selected for
       the international event squads a minimum of three months prior to final nominations for the
       international event.
    3. Should such selection not be notified by the tier-one nation three calendar months prior to
       the final nominations closing date then the player may only represent his /her elected
       tier-two nation in the international event.
3. When a player is named in the final team and earns a test cap for a nation according to the
   eligibility rules, he/she is deemed to have elected to play for that nation. For the avoidance of
   doubt, selection for a domestic representative match does not constitute a commitment to
   International event matches for such a nation.
4. A player who has been selected and earned a test cap for a nation cannot then elect to represent
   another nation in the same tier level in the same calendar year.
5. Pursuant to Rules (2) and (2.8) a player may change from a tier two to another tier two for which
   he /she is eligible, with the approval of FIT and subject to the condition that a player may only
   make one such change in the stand-down two (2) year period. The two-year period starts from the
   final completion date of the competition of any previous selection.
6. Pursuant to rule (2.8), a player is entitled to move between a tier one and a tier two nation
   freely save that a player may not change their national team during an international event
   inclusive of any international test matches in which that player is participating and may only
   represent one nation during an international event.
7. The burden of proof in establishing eligibility is on the player and the nation they wish to
   represent. If a player plays for an international match for a national team that he/she is not
   eligible to represent both the player and the national team that selected him/her may be guilty
   of misconduct.
8. Where a player considers that he/she is eligible to join a national team squad based on rule (2)
   above before he/she joins that squad, he/she shall provide proof to the nation wishing to select
   him/her and FIT. In the case of eligibility under rules (2.1), (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) the
   player shall provide the Nation and FIT with a copy of the relevant birth certificate, passport,
   evidence of residency, evidence of parent or grandparent and /or employment.
9. Where a player is not able to provide a copy of the relevant birth certificate, passport,
   parentage or grandparentage, or evidence of residency the matter shall be referred to the
   relevant FIT Authorising Officer and the player shall only be entitled to represent the national
   team if he/she can provide satisfactory evidence to FIT authorising officers that the player is
   eligible to do so. Affidavits by a player will not be considered satisfactory evidence.
10. Nations shall promptly, before or upon the requested date, provide FIT with a copy of any
    evidence they have relied on pursuant to rules (2) and (3). Where a nation fails to do so, or
    FIT does not consider the evidence satisfactory, the relevant player shall not be entitled to
    represent that national team.
11. In the circumstances set out in rule (8) above or in the event of the eligibility of a player to
    represent a nation being uncertain or in dispute, upon the written request of any member
    organisation of FIT, it shall be referred to the Event management team leader for determination.
    The decision of the Event Management team leader shall be final and binding and not subject to
    appeal.
12. A player shall be considered eligible under rule (2) (a), (b), (c) if the relevant qualifying
    Nation no longer exists as a sovereign state or political entity (State). Where a qualifying
    birth certificate refers to a former state a player may nominate the nation he/she wishes to
    represent from FIT-recognised NTOs that constitute that former state.
13. Once a nomination of a nation under rule (12) is made, a player may not change the nomination to
    another NTO. A player eligible to play for more than one nation is still entitled to change
    his/her nation in accordance with this rule but their new nation cannot be a former entity of
    the previous state.

Age criteria in relevant divisions. It is normal for “Senior” divisions to specify a minimum age by
