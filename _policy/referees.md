officiate at a Federation Event:

1.  The referee must be a member of an affiliated Member NTA.
2.  The referee must be endorsed by the Director of Referees from his/her Member NTA. If the Member
    country does not have a Director of Referees then endorsement would need to come from the
    President, Chairperson, CEO or from the person nominated by the President, Chairperson or CEO of
    the Member NTA as heading the referee structure for that NTA. Such endorsement would need to be

    within their respective nations prior to nomination and subsequent selection.
4.  World Cup Referees would be expected to be a minimum of Black Badge Referee. Dispensation can be
    sought from the FIT Director of Referees for Referee/s not at the required Badge Level, but who
    would be considered to have the necessary skill set both on and off field to attend this event.
    Decisions on this would be made in consultation with the FIT Referee Commission and the Member
    NTA and advised quickly. Consideration would be given to tournament requirements (Referee
    numbers required) and developmental prospects for that nation as well as the need to have
    credible referees officiating in the World Cup.
5.  In the majority of cases the FIT Director of Referees or a member of the FIT Referee Commission
    either appointed or designated or a suitably qualified referee coach/assessor authorized by the
    FIT Director of Referees would have assessed the referee over a twelve (12) month period on the
    lead up to a World Cup. This may include provision for referees to be viewed via electronic
    telecommunications devices (SKYPE, DVD, YouTube etc) on a case by case basis where a physical
    viewing is not cost efficient or effective.
6.  Clarification on Designated: Is a person assigned by the FIT Director of Referees with the
    necessary background knowledge and experience to assist with recommendations for selections. 
7.  FIT Referee Checklists to support referees not at Black Badge would also need to be provided
    with the nomination.

## Selection of National Squad Referees

The following selection standards should be used when identifying and assessing referees for
national tournaments in Member NTA's as a prelude for selection to FIT Events.

1.  Potential National Squad Referees should be assessed over at least a period of twenty-four (24)
    months at their respective national tournaments by their National Referees Commission.

    by the FIT Director of Referees.

    Commission requirements is to be submitted to the FIT Director of Referees. This list is to
    include referees selected from the original squad as reserves and ranked in order. It is for
    each Member Nation to determine the method of ranking for referees and although finals
    appointments through a national event is an acceptable method of ranking, it is also
    acknowledged that country commitments and the level of financial contributions, and other
    factors may be considered in the final rankings. The FIT standard is that the method of
    selection is transparent to all referees giving them reasonable notice of the expectations.
